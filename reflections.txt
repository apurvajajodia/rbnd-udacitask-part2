# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------

1. How long did you spend working on this project? About 3 hours
2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
 I started off the project without checking the helps given in the lesson, yet I was able to figure out a few things on my own, which felt quite good.
3. What two additional features did you build? Why?I think it is important to have the functionality to delete items and modify the priority
4. Where do you still have room to grow?
 Yes, lots of opportunity. We can allow the user to select a list and then decide if he wants to add, remove, alter the items. We can also allow them to make a new list all together.
